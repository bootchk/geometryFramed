Point
-----

>>> pa = Point2(1.5, 2, 'A')
>>> pa
Point2(1.50, 2.00, A)


Points have a location but NOT a direction or length.

Location is x and y properties:

>>> pa.x
1.5


Points have no magnitude (length) method.
(The method does not exist, it is not that the 'length' is zero.)

>>> abs(pa)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'Point2'


Points have no direction (angle to vectors).

>>> pa.angle(va)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Point2' object has no attribute 'angle'



Point arithmetic
----------------

In group theory, point arithmetic is ????, where subtraction but not addition is defined.

The difference of points (subtraction) is a vector.

>>> pb = Point2(1, 1, 'A')
>>> pa - pb
Vector2(0.50, 1.00, A)


The difference of the same point is a vector.
The zero of point subtraction is a vector.

>>> pa - pa
Vector2(0.00, 0.00, A)


Points do NOT add.

>>> pa + pb
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Point addition is not defined and meaningless.



Geometry
--------

Points connect to themselves.

>>> pa.connect(pa)
LineSegment2(Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), 'A')


The distance from a point to itself is a Dimension with value 0.
>>> pa.distance(pa)
Dimension(0.0, 'A')


nearestPoint() method reduces the connection of a point to another object
to the point of intersection of the connection.
>>> abSegment = pa.connect(pb)
>>> pa.nearestPoint(abSegment)
Point2(1.50, 2.00, A)


Two points intersect if they are the same point.

>>> pa.intersect(pa)
Point2(1.50, 2.00, A)
 
Two different points do not intersect.

>>> pa.intersect(pb) is None
True

(TODO other geometrical objects intersect(other) method does not allow other a Point2.)


Truthiness of point c intersection with LineSegment defined by points a, b 
is determined by the isBetween function


>>> isBetween( pa, pb, pa)
True
>>> isBetween( pa, pb, pb)
True


Stretch
-------

A point can be stretched between frames by a vector
that defines the difference in scale between frames.
