 >>> from geometryFramed.point import Point2
 >>> from geometryFramed.vector import Vector2
 >>> from geometryFramed.ellipse import Ellipse
 >>> from geometryFramed.lineSegment import LineSegment2


Test objects
------------

>>> centerPoint = Point2(2.0, 2.0, 'A')
>>> centerPoint
Point2(2.00, 2.00, A)

>>> pb = Point2(4, 2.0, 'A')
>>> pb
Point2(4.00, 2.00, A)

>>> anEllipseInA = Ellipse(center = centerPoint, radiusX=1, radiusY=2)
>>> anEllipseInA
Ellipse(center=2.00, 2.00, radiusX=1.00, radiusY=2.00, frame=A)


Methods
-------

Radii of an ellipse are properties

TODO

Perp is defined.

>>> perp = anEllipseInA.perp(pb)
>>> perp
Vector2(-1.00, 0.00, A)


Tangent is defined.

>>> tangent = anEllipseInA.tangent(pb)
>>> tangent
Vector2(0.00, 1.00, A)


Perp is orthogonal to the tangent
TODO orthogonal() method for vector

# TODO >>> perp.perp() == tangent
# >>> perp.angleTo(tangent)
>>> perp.dot(tangent).value == 0
True


Enclosure
---------

A point outside an ellipse is not enclosed.
The center of an ellipse is enclosed.
A point on the edge of an ellipse is enclosed.
A line segment whose points are enclosed is also enclosed.
TODO


Circle for ellipse
------------------

The circle for an ellipse is the ellipse unstretched into a circle
at the origin of a TEMP frame.

>>> circleForEllipse = anEllipseInA.circleFor()
>>> circleForEllipse
Circle(center=0.00, 0.00, radius=1.00, frame=TEMP)


An ellipse knows the vector that will scale the ellipse to circle.
The vector is in a TEMP frame.
(The circle must be translated to the origin of the TEMP frame before scaling.)

>>> anEllipseInA.getScaleVectorToCircle()
Vector2(1.00, 0.50, TEMP)


Radius of circle for ellipse is min radii of ellipse.

>>> circleForEllipse.radius == min(anEllipseInA.radiusX, anEllipseInA.radiusY)
True


Geometry
--------

!!! Algorithms are approximate.
Exact geometry algorithms for ellipse are hard.
These algorithms suffer worse approximations as an ellipse is flattened severely.

Connect is defined but approximate.

Point on radial through minor axis connects

>>> pb.connect(anEllipseInA)
LineSegment2(Point2(4.00, 2.00, A), Point2(3.00, 2.00, A), 'A')


Point on ellipse connects
>>> pc = Point2(3, 2.0, 'A')
>>> pc.connect(anEllipseInA)
LineSegment2(Point2(3.00, 2.00, A), Point2(3.00, 2.00, A), 'A')

Line segment connects


Approximate:
the intersection of a connecting segment to an ellipse
and the ellipse
is a point that is not necessarily exactly ON the ellipse.
(ellipse.on() is not defined yet
The classical model for ellipse gives an exact definition for ON.
But we are using a different model.)
TODO

Connecting segment to a point is not necessarily orthogonal
to the tangent at the point of intersection of the connecting segment to the ellipse.
TODO

Line segment parallel to ellipse connects
>>> pd = Point2(4, 4, 'A')
>>> pe = Point2(4, -4, 'A')
>>> deSegment = LineSegment2(pd, pe)
>>> anEllipseInA.connect(deSegment)
LineSegment2(Point2(4.00, 2.00, A), Point2(3.00, 2.00, A), 'A')

... and vice versa
>>> deSegment.connect(anEllipseInA)
LineSegment2(Point2(4.00, 2.00, A), Point2(3.00, 2.00, A), 'A')



Line segment parallel to ellipse does not intersect.
# FIXME NotImplemented
>>> anEllipseInA.intersect(deSegment)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError


TODO more connection tests


Frame safety
------------

An ellipse is in the frame of its defining center point.

TODO




>>> translation = Vector2(2, 2, "TEMP")

>>> scale = Vector2(1, 2, "TEMP")


Translate point

>>> centerPoint.translate(translation)
Point2(4.00, 4.00, TEMP)
