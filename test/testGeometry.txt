Geometry
--------

Geometrical methods: intersect, connect, distance, nearest.
Test these methods between all combinations of two geometrical objects.
Also test nested combinations of of these methods where the result
of one method is fed to another method.
(These tests are 'axioms' of the package: things you can assume,
but in classical math, many would be called theorems provable
from a smaller set of classical axioms.)


>>> pa = Point2(1.5, 2.0, 'A')
>>> pb = Point2(1, 1, 'A')



Point to point geometry
-----------------------

Geometry is defined for point to point

>>> pa.connect(pb)
LineSegment2(Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), Point2(1.00, 1.00, A), 'A')


Different points do not intersect

>>> pa.intersect(pb) is None
True


Distance  between points yields a scalar Dimension in the same frame
>>> pa.distance(pb)
Dimension(1.118033988749895, 'A')

Nearest point is the other point.

>>> pa.nearestPoint(pb) == pb
True


Geometry from a point to itself
-------------------------------

A point connects to itself.

Distance from a point to itself is zero.

>>> pa.distance(pa)		
Dimension(0.0, 'A')


A point intersects itself.
>>> pa.intersect(pa) == pa
True




Point/LineSegment geometry
--------------------------

>>> abSegment = LineSegment2(pa, pb)
>>> pc = Point2(4, 4, 'A')


A line segment connects to a point.

>>> abSegment.connect(pc)
LineSegment2(Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), Point2(4.00, 4.00, A), 'A')

... and vice versa

>>> pa.connect(abSegment)
LineSegment2(Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), 'A')


A line segment connects to a point on the line segment by a segment.

>>> abSegment.connect(pa)
LineSegment2(Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), Point2(1.50, 2.00, A), 'A')

... and the connecting segment has zero magnitude

>>> abs(abSegment.connect(pa)).value
0.0


Line segment intersect point.


Intersection of a line segment and point that defines a line segment is the point.

>>> abSegment.intersect(pa) == pa
True



LineSegment to LineSegment geometry
--------------------------------

A line segment intersects itself yielding a copy of the line segment itself.
FIXME currently fails

>>> abSegment.intersect(abSegment) == abSegment
True


Parallel segments do not intersect (returns None.)
>>> paOffset = pa + Vector2(2, 2, 'A')
>>> pbOffset = pb + Vector2(2, 2, 'A')
>>> paOffsetpbOffsetSegment = LineSegment2(paOffset, pbOffset)
>>> abSegment.intersect(paOffsetpbOffsetSegment) is None
True



Distance is positive
--------------------

Distance from a point to a line is positive, even for points on different sides of a line.

TODO


Vector geometry
---------------

Geometry (intersect, connect, distance) is NOT defined for vectors.

>>> vb = Vector2(1.5, 2.0, 'B')
>>> pc = Point2(1.5, 2.0, 'B')
	
>>> vb.connect(pc)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Vector2' object has no attribute 'connect'
	
>>> vb.intersect(pc)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Vector2' object has no attribute 'intersect'
	
>>> vb.distance(pc)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Vector2' object has no attribute 'distance'



Intersection
------------

The intersection of a first segment and the connecting segment 
that connects a point to the first segment...

>>> firstSegment = LineSegment2(pa, pb)
>>> aPoint = Point2(4, 4, 'A')
>>> connectingSegment = aPoint.connect(firstSegment)
>>> intersection = firstSegment.intersect(connectingSegment)
>>> intersection
Point2(1.50, 2.00, A)

...is a point on (intersects) the connecting segment (an end point),

>>> intersection.intersect(connectingSegment)
Point2(1.50, 2.00, A)

...and it is the first point of the connecting segment

>>> intersection == pa
True

... and it is on the first segment (not necessarily an end point.)
>>> intersection.intersect(firstSegment)
Point2(1.50, 2.00, A)



The intersection of a first point and the connecting segment that connects said point to a first segment 
is said first point. (This fails in PyEuclid.)
(As a set, a connecting segment includes the point which the connecting segment connects to other.)

>>> intersection = pa.intersect(pa.connect(firstSegment))
>>> intersection == pa
True



Certain intersections are improper???  TODO more test cases



TODO test all geometry combinations
