    Orthogonal of rect in direction of a point.
    I.E. outward pointing vector orthogonal to side nearest point.
    Point can be inside, outside, or on the rect.
    Orthogonal is NOT a line passing through the point.
    The orthogonal is just a vector.
    
    Implementation: four combinations of left and right of diagonals.
    That is, divide rect into quadrants by its two diagonals.
    Each quadrant has an orthogonal.
    
    The rect is aligned in its own coordinate system,
    but need not be aligned in the scene.
