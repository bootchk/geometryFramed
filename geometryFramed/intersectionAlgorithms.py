'''
Alternative intersection algorithms for line segments.
Note that the algorithms in algorithms.py are defective: 
they are not able to return a line segment for overlapping, parallel segments,
but always return a point or None.

From "Computational Geometry" by O'Rourke, p. 249

Work in progress (not finished for parallel segments)

Frame safety not enforced: require points in same frame
