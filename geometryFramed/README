About
=====

geometryFramed is a pure Python, 2D geometry package that enforces frame (coordinate system) safety.

It is intended for use in 2D GUI applications where many frames are used, e.g. using Qt.
For such a use, frame safety provides ease of programming.
The package raises an exception when a programmer improperly mixes geometrical objects from different frames.
For such a use, handling of degeneracy is also important:
geometrical objects come from arbitrary user input events, and may be degenerate.

The package is also intended to be robust.
It uses assertions liberally, as pre and post conditions, and to provide frame safety.
It has a complete test suite, including high-level, axiomatic tests.
(However that is only partially implemented, but its moving in the right direction.)

Foundations of this package
===========================

Derived from PyEuclid copyright 2006 Alex Holkner.

Based on algorithms documented by:
- Paul Bourke, http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke
- "Computational Geometry in C" by O'Rourke.


Modified:

- axiom/model changes
-- Points are not Vectors

- coding 
-- separated classes, one to a module
-- eliminated support for old-style classes (eliminated metaclass stuff to support slots.)
-- eliminated support for swizzling
-- added docstrings and tests

- added algorithms from "Computational Geometry in C" by O'Rourke.
- eliminated 3D geometry
- eliminated transforms (should be separate package, often provided by a GUI framework.)
- typeConvert module converts to types from the Qt framework, and applies transforms

- added Ellipse and modified Circle (an Ellipse is more general.)

- improved handling of degeneracy: 
-- self to self geometry
-- null vector
-- connect() always return a lineSegment, even if zero length


Goals
=====

The goals of this package are:

- Readable and maintainable code
- Frame safety: two operands must be in the same frame (coordinate system).
- Type safety: a Point is not interpreted as a Vector.
- Robustness: provided tests form a complete set over all edge cases
- Large geometrical objects: SegmentStrings (e.g. Rectangle and PolyCurve) TODO
- A set of basic geometry operations: connect(), intersect(), distance(), nearestPoint()
- Finite, computational geometry: infinite lines, rays are not exposed


These are NOT goals:

- abstracting over dimension: this is for 2D geometry.
- performance: secondary to correctness


Frame Safety
============

This package is designed for applications where multiple frames are used,
for example in GUI apps having world, view, and local frames (coordinate systems.)

The motivation is: it is easier to program with explicit frames,
than to use them implicitly, that is to keep in your head the proofs that you are not mixing frames.

Every object may optionally be created having a frame.
The frame is simply an object that identifies the frame, and compares for equality to other frames.
Typically, it is a string name of a frame.

Most methods having more than one parameter require all parameters to be in the same frame.

Even Scalars have a frame.

The frame defaults to 'NoneFrame'.

See wiki about free and bound vectors.


Type Safety and Polymorphism
============================

Where a Vector is required, a Point is not allowed.
The negation and addition methods are NOT defined for Points but defined for Vectors.
Subtraction is defined for Points, yielding a Vector.
(AFAIK, this is the more rigorous, classical math.)

Methods exist for type conversion, e.g. Point.asVector().

Vectors and Coordinates do not inherit Geometrical.
You COULD make vectors Geometrical, but it is not useful:
All vectors connect and intersect at the frame's origin.
Also, mixing vectors and geometrical objects is suspect.

Points are Coordinates.
Points extend Coordinates with arithmetic operations and Geometrical.

Methods of the Geometrical class are polymorphic:
taking parameters that are instances of other subclasses of Geometrical.


Arithmetic
==========

All internal arithmetic is in floating point.


TODO
====

These are suggestions for improvements:

more tests. Capture tests from the planar project.

Testing floating point boundary conditions.
Safe checking for floating point equality, e.g. for dot() == 0

SegmentString class (composite) a geometrical object (connect, intersect, distance)
nearest() part of GeometricalABC, returning a Segment from a SegmentString

Segment class with subclasses LineSegment2 and CurveSegment2

LineSegment not directional(?)  Clarify and test use of _swap()

Ellipse defined as a scaled circle is not as defined by most GUI frameworks.
