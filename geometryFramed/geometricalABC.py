class Geometrical(object):
    '''
    Mixin behaviour for geometrical objects.
    Abstract base class (ABC), abstracting over dimension (2D, 3D, etc.)
    
    This is what it means to be a geometrical object: support these operations.
    Operations are 'metrical', i.e. measuring.

    def intersect(self, other):
      '''
      Geometrical object which is intersection of self and other.
      
      Typically a Point, but it can be otherwise.
      E.G. lineA.intersect(lineA) == lineA

      '''
      The shortest LineSegment between self and other.
      
      Ensure: always a lineSegment, never None, but may have length() == 0

      Scalar length of self.connect(other)

      ''' 
      Point on other that is nearest self. 
      
      Implementation: second end point of directed line segment that connects self to other.
      
      TODO test cases to insure we always swap correctly.

class Geometrical2D(Geometrical):
  '''
  ABC Every subclass SHOULD reimplement.
  
  This class is not really necessary.
  The effective implementations of connect() and intersect() call this API.
  If this were not here, and you fail to effect these deferred methods,
  you would still get an exception, just not NotImplementedError.
  
  Specializes for 2D.
